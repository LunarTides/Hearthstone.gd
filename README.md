# Hearthstone.gd
A [Hearthstone.js](https://github.com/LunarTides/Hearthstone.js) rewrite in Godot.

**This is _very_ early on and is not ready for use at all.**

## Plan
This is meant to be an improved version of Hearthstone.js. Ideally, this will be on feature parity but with Multiplayer and a UI.

This is a very big undertaking considering that hsjs has gotten ~1.3k commits over the course of 2 years, and now i also need to deal with things outside of my comfort zone (ui, art, 3d models, multiplayer, etc...), but i have learned a lot since hsjs so it might not take as long to get back to where i am.

## Features
- Multiplayer
- UI
- playing cards?
- uhhh... deckcodes??
- idk fill this in later

## Missing Features
- Everything else
