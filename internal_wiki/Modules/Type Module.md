The module responsible of Card Types (Minions, Spells, etc...).

Yes, the *concept* of card types does not exist in core. You might be wondering; "If even card types doesn't exist in core, what *does*?". Well, everything that isn't it's own module.

The individual cards are too different to be defined in this module, so specific types, like [Minion](Minion Module), are in their own submodules.

The individual modules are specified here. (Although as submodules, they are not referenced in the actual type module, rather the submodules reference this.)
- [[Hero Module]]
- [[Hero Power Module]]
- [[Minion Module]]
- [[Spell Module]]
